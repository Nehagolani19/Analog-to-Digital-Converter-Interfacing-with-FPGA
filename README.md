# Analog-to-Digital-Converter-Interfacing-with-FPGA
This project interfaces the ADC0809 analog-to-digital converter with an FPGA using Verilog. It reads analog input signals, converts them to digital form, and processes the data on FPGA. Useful for integrating sensors and real-world signals into digitalÂ systems.
